# Basic World Simulation

**Description:**

A game that simulates a two-dimensional virtual world. The simulation includes a day-night cycle, trees with leaves that move in the wind, fall in the autumn, and grow back. The game avatar can walk, run, jump, and fly.

**Files:**

The program contains 3 packages written in Java:
- `main` - includes the game manager.
- `util` - includes util files that are responsible for the colors in the game and the layout of the land.
- `worlds` - includes files that are responsible for the variety of features of the world - avatar, trees, sky, sun, light and darkness, and more.
- `assets` - some images for the different poses the avatar can be in - resting, walking, running, jumping, flying.
- `uml` - a UML diagram that describes the structure of the program.
